Clone of Platformer.HACK_04b

MAIN
Test code for HandleCollisions() rectangle comparison
This should be straight port to PlatformerSMS

Add gridlines
Tiles become 32x32 for tiles and change Player to be 32x64
Combine velocity arrays and tile collision look up arrays
This would be SMS game implementation but 2x the size
i.e.
32x32 instead of 16x16
